objectives of the course.\r\n        We went through different kind of game design business models. \r\n        We split into teams made for us where we work on the final course segment, setting up a gaming company. Together with the group, we got the Angry Birds game released in 2007 for Iphone.\r\n        The card had to fill in the sections: customer segment, distribution, value and revenue.\r\n        <br></br>  <br></br>\r\n        After that, we went back to the groups and started setting up a game company.\r\n        Our game company is called Bugisoft and our team consists of two artists, two coders and two designers. \r\n        We filled out our game company player cards and built our game company values ​​and background story. \r\n        <br></br>  <br></br>\r\n        We also had a guest from Cursor, Sami Moisio, talking about Cursor's services when founding a company in the Kotka-Hamina region.  \r\n        Cursor provides free advice on starting a business. You will find a material bank of important forms. The downside is that the materials are in Finnish, not in English.\r\n        <br></br>  <br></br>\r\n        Even though I knew something about game design business models, some of the terms were new to me. In addition, working with new students was exciting but also fun.\r\n\r\n        <br></br>  <br></br>\r\n        Here is something about our company Bugisoft:\r\n        We believe the Bugisoft name is a seal of quality, packed with iconic characters, narrative and fun gameplay.\r\n        Bugisoft has been founded by six excited, passionate and dynamic entrepreneurs from Kymenlaakso\r\n        who believe that happiness is about developing games.

This information will be utilized in the next step as we build a persona for our players.\r\n<br></br>\r\nIn class, we discussed how to find an audience. Things that affect the audience include platform, genre, artstyle, content, difficulty and duration.\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\nWhat should take consider when you are thinking about company's target audience:\r\n<br></br>\r\nThe first thing to think about is what kind of games your company makes / wants to make. \r\n        What kind of target audience is there for such games and what other games are the players in the target audience playing.\r\n        <br></br>  <br></br>\r\n        \r\nSecond, you should look into games of the same style. What is their target audience. Next, you should list your three biggest competitors and look at their demographics\r\nand then maping the findings somewhere. \r\n<br></br>  <br></br>\r\nResources for looking demographics is: \r\n<br></br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.appannie.com/en/\">Appannie</a> and <a href=\"https://steamspy.com/\">Steamspy</a> for example.\r\n<br></br>  <br></br>\r\nAnd on third, similarities and differences should be considered.\r\n<br></br>  <br></br>\r\n\r\nToday's guests were Janne Niittymäki Ivan Lugovoy and a surprise guest.

Actually I would surprise more if Xamk wasn't even mention.\r\n<br></br> <br></br>\r\nI chose Nitro Games as my gaming company because I got to know the company already in 2009 and it was the first Kotka-based gaming company I got to know.\r\nMy first contact with the company was a game called East India Company and Kustaan sota. \r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nNitro Games was founded in 2007 by CEO Jussi Tähtinen and CSO Antti Villanen.\r\nThe company is based in Kotka, where it is headquartered. At the moment, the company also has a branch office in Helsinki. Nitro Games originally made PC games for Windows. The publisher has worked e.g. paradoxical interaction. Nitro Games has also become familiar with translating the PC version of Alan Wake with Remedy. \r\nCurrently, Nitro Games focuses on mobile games for IOs as well as Android devices. And if I haven't misunderstood then Nitro Games will still be subcontracting console / PC games.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nNitro games switched from PC to free to play mobile games and listed on the stock exchange in 2017. \r\nBut as I said earlier, Nitro Games is apparently still subcontracting console / PC games.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.gamereactor.fi/artikkelit/74053/Haastattelussa+Nitro+Games/\">Fun article in Gamereactor about Nitro Games newest relese game called East India Company in 2009 </a>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"link-box\">\r\n        <a href=\"/#\" className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>{/* modal-01 End */}\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"modal-04\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\r\n        <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/modals/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n      <div className=\"description-box\">\r\n        <h4>Intro to pitching</h4>\r\n        <p>\r\nWe participated in the game week event in Kouvola.

MusicFairyTales produces music fairy tales in traditional formats such as print books and audio books.\r\nTheir plans for the near future include bringing stories to life on interactive touch walls. Music fairytales combine classical music, stories and illustrations. \r\nThe touch walls will add a gaming aspect, allowing players to step inside the characters to complete different tasks. Music Fairy Tales is already sold one wall to Oodi.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nWe had the opportunity to get acquainted with the projects produced in the summer as well as the escape game implemented on the wall.\r\nI really liked how the wall game looked like and really liked Urajärvi point & click escape game. \r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nAlso there was Salli Loikkanen from Lizard Hazard Games telling about her journey in game industry.

He said that its good to recherch publisher portfolio. \r\n        Arsi also told that his publisher have helped him with connections, marketing etc. He also gave a tip that you should never promise relase day because it may cause trouble if the game delay.\r\n        <br></br><br></br>\r\n        He also give a tip how he usaly works in a day and can do productive stuff.\r\n        He said doing every day even one hour something active will help you schechuel your days and soon you will notice that you can do actualy things much more faster that before.\r\n        I personally really liked this tip and I'm going to test this in a some point.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <a href=\"https://todoist.com/fi/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique\">link to really interesting technique for productive work</a>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Starting to make games you should firstly do lot of small projects for example game jam games. Avoid doing solo projects!\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          Try to make connections with other developers. \r\n          <br></br>\r\n          Try to avoid remake \"better\" version of some game.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          Try to understand current market and design your game using trends or try to predict new trends.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          Don't do online game for your first project!\r\n          <br></br><br></br>\r\n          Making the game you need remember to design something fun for your game. You need to acctually use  time for design fun elements to game.\r\n          Arsi said that cool game is easy to made but making fun game is much more complicated. And I acctually agreed this argument. \r\n          Focus to make first the primary gameplay loop works nice and smooth. Then you can continue next phase. Don't leave sounds later on because game feelings coming from sounds. \r\n          Development process is slow. And you need to understand that good is enough.\r\n          <br></br><br></br>\r\n          Designing your game you need to remember to guide the player torwards the most fun way to play but still leave room for player own expession. Give more than one way of solving problems.\r\n          And remember to give insted of taking away! Remember also use calm moments to keep intense moment of the game.\r\n          Remember to play your game often and take notes of the game sessions. Learn to take feedback and learn to understand it. Play & analyze different kind of games. \r\n        <br></br><br></br>\r\n    \r\n        Marketing should start early and do marketing regularry. Look at other successful indie developers marketing models and take advantage for that. Use different kind of socialmedia platforms. Ask youtubers and/or\r\n        streamers to play your game. \r\n        <br></br><br></br>\r\n        Finnish your game is the most hardest thing to do. Early access is really good for small development teams. \r\n        <br></br><br></br>\r\n        And last but not least Arsi gave tip that you should log your hours some where to see how many hours you have been worked. \r\n\r\n        </p>\r\n        <a href=\"https://gamesounds.xyz/\">Free sounds from gamesounds.xyz</a>\r\n        <br></br><br></br>\r\n        <a href=\"https://freesound.org/\">Free sounds from freesounds.org</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"link-box\">\r\n        <a href=\"/#\" className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>{/* modal-01 End */}\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"modal-08\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\r\n        <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/modals/8.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n      <div className=\"description-box\">\r\n        <h4>Fill in a word cloud</h4>\r\n<h4>Game Development Terms</h4>\r\n        <p>\r\nP2W meaning \"Pay to Win\" to refer to games that allow players to purchase items or abilities that give them an advantage in the game, either over other players or NPCs.\r\nP2W is a very controversial aspect of gaming, especially in multiplayer games.

The games are free to download, but are full of upscales and in game store purchases\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nPremium is the most traditional model, premium games are apps that are sold at a specific price point.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nCPLU meansCost Per Livestock Unit\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nCPI means Cost Per Install that is specific to mobile apps. \r\nBasically, as the game app advertiser you pay a specific dollar amount every time a user installs your game from one of the served ads running in your campaigns\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nIn-app purchases (IAP) occur when a user purchases an item in an app or game with real money. \r\nSome examples of what users purchase can be: an extra life, an upgrade to speed up a task, cosmetic items for a character, or hints for a puzzle.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nVenture Capital or Venture Capitalist is The money or the person or organization that invests money in startup or small companies. \r\nA tremendous amount of venture capital has been invested in the computer field, especially in Internet startups.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nA pitch is a concise description of your game, meant to sell the experience to a specific audience. \r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nLtd. is a standard abbreviation for \"limited,\" a form of corporate structure available in countries including the U.K., Ireland, and Canada, and appears as a suffix after the company name.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\noyj is finnish public limited company.\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\noy is same like ltd\r\n<br></br><br></br>\r\nA microtransaction is a business model where users can purchase virtual items for small amounts of money. \r\nMicrotransactions often appear in free-to-play games, meaning there is no cost to download the game, just a cost to buy the online virtual products.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"link-box\">\r\n        <a href=\"/#\" className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>{/* modal-01 End */}\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"modal-09\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\r\n        <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/modals/9.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n      <div className=\"description-box\">\r\n        <h4>Game Design Canvas</h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Game Design Canvas\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/diary/suunnitelma.PNG\" alt=\"\" />\r\n        <br></br>\r\n        <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/diary/kuva.PNG\" alt=\"\" />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"link-box\">\r\n        <a href=\"/#\" className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>{/* modal-01 End */}\r\n\r\n    \r\n    <div id=\"modal-10\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\r\n        <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/modals/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n      <div className=\"description-box\">\r\n        <h4>Monetization and game loops</h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        \r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"link-box\">\r\n        <a href=\"/#\" className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>{/* modal-01 End */}\r\n\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"modal-11\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\r\n        <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/modals/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n      <div className=\"description-box\">\r\n        <h4>Monetisation model of similar games</h4>\r\n        <p>      \r\n    I selected Angry Birds 2 as the game to play. Our game's competitors were e.g. Rovio (Angry Birds), Team 17(Worms), Wicked Witch Software(Catabult King) etc.\r\n    According to Rovio's website, their business model is divided into two models. \r\n    Free to play model in terms of games, but the other is the licensing of the brand around everything outside of games.\r\n    <br></br><br></br>\r\n    Free to play model in Rovio:    \r\n    The Games business unit creates, develops and publishes mobile games based on the Angry Birds brand as well as new IPs. \r\n    Rovio’s games have been downloaded more than 4.5 billion times, and during 2020 Rovio's games had an average of over 30 million monthly active users. \r\n    At the end of 2020, approximately 95% of Rovio’s group revenue came from games. \r\n    Rovio has seven games studios in total – two in Espoo (Finland), one in Stockholm (Sweden), Copenhagen (Denmark), Montreal and Toronto (Canada), as well as a studio in Izmir (Turkey) \r\n    called Ruby Games, which was acquired in 2021. Game studio operations are built on Genre Mastery, which means that each studio has a clear genre focus.\r\n    <br></br><br></br>\r\n    Brand Licensing in Rovio:\r\n    Rovio licenses the Angry Birds brand and its related characters to selected partners. The Company’s licensing business began in late 2010 and in 2020 represented approximately 5% of the Group’s business. \r\n    Since 2010, over 2 billion units of Rovio’s licensed consumer products and services have been sold, with the Company’s videos – aired on channels such as YouTube and Netflix \r\n    – viewed more than three billion times. \r\n    In 2021, there are over 100 licensees globally, who use the Angry Birds brand in various different products and services such as toys, clothing, \r\n    restaurant promotions and location-based entertainment (eg. activity parks). \r\n    In June, Rovio signed an agreement with IMG Licensing for global representation for Angry Birds brand licensing in consumer products and location-based entertainment.\r\n    <br></br><br></br>\r\n    Angry Birds 2 Core loop is simple. Player start level, player needs to destory enemies towers, player clear level and start again. Meta game around the core loop gives\r\n    game more playable content and something that users can trying to achieve. Monetization around the Angry Birds 2 are loot boxes witch you can bought by using diamonds that you can get \r\n    playing different challenges or buying diamond bundless using real money. You can use money to get extra trying in levels if you fail the level. You can all so get free loot box or extra trying\r\n    by looking advertising video.\r\n    <br></br><br></br>\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"link-box\">\r\n        <a href=\"/#\" className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>{/* modal-01 End */}\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"modal-12\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\r\n        <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/modals/11.png\" alt=\"\" />\r\n      <div className=\"description-box\">\r\n        <h4>Publishing and pitching a game</h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Henri Brandt / Dark Amber Softworks and Malta quest\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"link-box\">\r\n        <a href=\"/#\" className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>{/* modal-01 End */}\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"modal-13\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\r\n        <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/modals/12.png\" alt=\"\" />\r\n      <div className=\"description-box\">\r\n        <h4>How to utilise game tech?</h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        \r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"link-box\">\r\n        <a href=\"/#\" className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>{/* modal-01 End */}\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"modal-14\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\r\n        <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/modals/14.png\" alt=\"\" />\r\n      <div className=\"description-box\">\r\n        <h4>Possibilities beyond gaming</h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        \r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"link-box\">\r\n        <a href=\"/#\" className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>{/* modal-01 End */}\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"modal-15\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\r\n        <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/modals/15.png\" alt=\"\" />\r\n      <div className=\"description-box\">\r\n        <h4>Presentations</h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        \r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"link-box\">\r\n        <a href=\"/#\" className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>{/* modal-01 End */}\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"modal-16\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\r\n        <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/modals/16.png\" alt=\"\" />\r\n      <div className=\"description-box\">\r\n        <h4>Wrap up</h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n        \r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"link-box\">\r\n        <a href=\"/#\" className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>{/* modal-01 End */}\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n  </div> {/* row End */}\r\n</section> {/* Portfolio Section End*/}\r\n      </React.Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}","import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nexport default class Header extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <React.Fragment>\r\n      {/*generated code*/}\r\n      <footer>\r\n  <div className=\"row\">\r\n    <div className=\"twelve columns\">\r\n      <ul className=\"copyright\">\r\n        <li>© Copyright 2021 Tarita Karhulahti</li>\r\n        <li>© Copyright 2014 CeeVee Design by <a href=\"https://www.styleshout.com/\">Styleshout</a></li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div id=\"go-top\"><a className=\"smoothscroll\" title=\"Back to Top\" href=\"#home\"><i className=\"icon-up-open\" /></a></div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</footer> {/* Footer End*/}\r\n       \r\n      </React.Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Header from './components/header/header';\nimport Portfolio from './components/portfolio/portfolio';\nimport Footer from './components/footer/footer';\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"App\">\n        <Header />\n        <Portfolio />\n        <Footer />\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
